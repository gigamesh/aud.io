# aud.io

Aud.io is a MVP of a social network for musicians and recording studios. I built it with Docker, TypeScript, MongoDB, Node, Express, React, Redux, Redux-saga, Material-UI & styled-components. It includes user registration with password encryption, form validation, live search, lazy-loaded images, and mobile-responsive CSS.
