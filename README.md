# aud.io

Aud.io is a MVP of a social network for musicians and recording studios. I built it with TypeScript, MongoDB, Node, Express, React, Redux, Redux-saga, Material-UI & styled-components. It includes user registration with password encryption, form validation, live search, lazy-loaded images, and mobile-responsive CSS.

## Developer guide:

- In cloned directory, run `npm install`
- To build locally, run `npm run dev`
- Install MongoDB & create a database called aud_io
